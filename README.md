# Cash-Register-Project
This Cash Register Project, returns change to the customer based on the price of the item, the amount of cash provided by the customer, and the amount of cash in the cash drawer.
It will also, display different messages to the user in different scenarios, such as when the customer provides too little cash or when the cash drawer doesn't have enough to issue the correct change.
